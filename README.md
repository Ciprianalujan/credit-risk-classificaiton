# Credit Risk Classification Analysis

This analysis uses supervised machine learning techniques that train and test a model based on loan risk. Using a dataset from a peer-to-peer lending service company, a model was built to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers who are assigned the result of "healthy" (0) or "high-risk" (1). The variables used to determine a customers creditworthiness are loan size, interest rate, borrower's annual income, debt to income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. With the loan status as label data and the variables provided, the machine learning models were used to provide a binary metric with a "1" to indicate a defult and "0" if current loans were in good standing. 

## Results

### Machine Learning Model 1:
   Precision: 92%
   Accuracy: 95%
   Recall: 94%


### Machine Learning Model 2:
   Precision: 99%
   Accuracy: 99%
   Recall: 99%
   
##Summary

Model 2 is more balanced than the first. It's predictions have more accuracy in predicting true positives and negatives. The data in the model must be balanced between negative and positive data points in order to accurately determine which loans are more likely to be repaid.
